# MNIST Recreation

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to learn the fundamentals of machine learning and the Pytorch library.

### Learning Approach:
1. Skim through [article](https://nextjournal.com/gkoehler/pytorch-mnist).
2. Reread article, but this time more thoroughly.
3. Read through code in "tutorial.py" independant of the article with the intention of understanding as much as possible.
4. Recreate code from tutorial with as little referencing as possible.
5. Complete README with explanation and the intention of utilizing the Feynman Technique.

### Explanation:
The purpose of this explanation is to uncover gaps in my knowledge and hopefully provide those interested with a decent explanation of this entry level machine learning project.
